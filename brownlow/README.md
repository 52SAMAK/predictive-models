# Brownlow

## Analysis Of AFL's Modelling Walkthrough
These tutorials will walk you through how to model the Brownlow Medal in R. We have teamed up with [Analysis Of AFL](https://twitter.com/anoafl), the co-creator of the fitzRoy package, to create an end-to-end walk through of how he modelled the Brownlow.

You are welcome to grab this code and chop and change the variables to how you see fit. Feel free to add additional variables and try to improve the model to make it your own.

The [takinghomecharlie](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/predictive-models/blob/master/brownlow/takinghomecharlie_end_to_end.R) walks you through the modelling process.

The [takinghomecharlie R Markdown Script](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/predictive-models/blob/master/brownlow/takinghomecharlie.Rmd) has detailed explanations of each step - although you will need to render this yourself in R Studio.

Alternatively, we have rendered it for you, simply download the [Taking Home Charlie HTML Document](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/predictive-models/blob/master/brownlow/Taking%20Home%20Charlie.html) and read along on any browser. Note that unlike Jupyter Notebooks, this won't render on GitHub.

## Betfair Data Scientist's Modelling Walkthrough
Tutorials from Betfair's Data Scientists will be available in the coming days. They will be in Python and R.
