# Predictive Models
This repo includes some of the Data Scientist team's open source predictive models, of which predictions are posted on the Hub. Models are produced in both R and Python.

## Aim
This repo aims to educate the Betfair community on creating your own end-to-end models to predict sport. It will be extremely informative and descriptive; the goal is for those without much coding experience to be able to read through the process and understand what is being done.

## Tutorials
* Created for the start of the 2018/19 EPL season, we have used publically available data to model odds and created automated betting strategies in our [EPL Predictions Tutorial](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/Predictive-Models/tree/master/EPL-Predictions-Model).
* Read through our [AFL Weekly Predictive Model Tutorial/Machine Learning Walkthrough](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/Predictive-Models/tree/master/AFL-Weekly-Predictive-Model). This generates weekly predictions for the AFL.
* We have created [FIFA World Cup 2018 modelling tutorial](https://github.com/betfair-datascientists/Predictive-Models/tree/master/World-Cup-2018), including a Machine Learning Walkthrough and Elo Model Walkthrough.
